*Why yet another blog?* Readme file
=====================

This repository [lists all the posts](https://github.com/Elgolfin/Blog/blob/master/index.md) I've written over the time.
I am using Github as a blog platform for the following reasons:

1. I am a Geek.
2. I want to keep a track of all changes (Wikipedia-like).
3. I love the fact this blog is open source.
4. You can even contribute (thanks to the pull requests).
5. It is free.

Here is the list of the last articles:
